# Urdu-Sentiment-Analysis-Pipeline-for-Social-Media-Content


This repository contains the implementation of an NLP pipeline for sentiment analysis of Urdu social media posts. The project was designed to classify Urdu text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, addressing the unique linguistic and technical challenges posed by the Urdu language and social media data.

The pipeline leverages advanced natural language processing techniques, custom preprocessing methods, and machine learning models to provide a comprehensive sentiment analysis solution for brands, influencers, and businesses targeting Urdu-speaking audiences.

Achievements
Phase 1: Text Preprocessing for Urdu Text

Developed a custom list of Urdu stopwords and implemented a function to remove them.
Processed noisy data by removing unnecessary punctuation, emojis, URLs, and hashtags, with the option to translate common emojis into sentiment.
Designed rules to filter out very short or incomplete posts that lack meaningful sentiment.
Phase 2: Stemming and Lemmatization

Implemented a custom Urdu stemming algorithm to reduce word variants to their base form.
Developed lemmatization rules to return words to their dictionary forms, handling gender, plurality, and tense variations.
Phase 3: Feature Extraction

Implemented tokenization for Urdu text, ensuring proper segmentation of Urdu script.
Extracted significant features using TF-IDF, presenting the most relevant terms contributing to sentiment.
Trained a Word2Vec model on the dataset and identified contextually similar words, such as finding synonyms for "اچھا (good)."
Phase 4: N-grams Analysis

Generated unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, highlighting the most frequent word combinations in Urdu social media posts.
Phase 5: Sentiment Classification Model

Built and trained a sentiment classification model using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).
Evaluated the model with metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Phase 6: Evaluation & Optimization

Analyzed model performance on validation data, identifying strengths and areas of improvement.
Discussed challenges in processing Urdu text, including morphology, colloquial language, and noisy social media data.
